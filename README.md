# scallop

A sweave document for 2014/2015 scallop fishing season, based on observer data.

The build uses a parent document 2015_scallop.Rnw with child documents for each Area/District (e.g., Area_YAK.Rnw). 
Additionally there is a full version of the document 2015_scallops_observer.Rnw though this will not be updated and will eventually be dropped.
